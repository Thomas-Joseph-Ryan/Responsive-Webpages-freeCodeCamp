                <p>
                    CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users -- how they are styled,
                    laid out, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language -- HTML is the most common
                    markup language, but you will also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a usable form for your audience. Browsers,
                    like Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer, are designed to present documens visually, for example, on
                    a computer screen, projector or printer.

                <p>
                    Web browsers apply CSS rules to a document to affect how they are displayed. A CSS rule is formed from:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            A set of properties, which have values set to update how the HTML content is displayed, for example 
                            I want my element's width to be 50% of its parent element, and its background to be red.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A selector, which selects the element(s) you want to apply the updated property values to. For example, 
                            I want to apply my CSS rule to all the paragraphs in my HTML document.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    A set of CSS rules contained within a stylesheet determines how a webpage should look.
                </p>

                    The above descriptions may or may not have made sense, so let's make sure things are clear by 
                    presenting a quick example.

                <div class="code-box">
                    <code class="html-code">

                            &lt;head>
                            &lt;meta charset="utf-8">

                            &lt;/head>
                            &lt;body>
                            &lt;h1>Hello World!&lt;/h1>
                            &lt;p>This is my first CSS example&lt;/p>
                            &lt;/body>
                        &lt;/html>
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Now let's look at a very simple CSS example containing two rules:
                </p>
                <div class="code-box">
                    <code class="css-code">
                        h1 {
                                color: blue;
                                background-color: yellow;
                                border: 1px solid black;
                            }
                        p {
                                color: red;
                            } 
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The first rule starts with an h1 selector, which means that it will apply its property values 
                    to the &lth1> element. It contains three properties and their values (each property/value pair 
                    is called a declaration):
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The first one sets the text color to blue.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The second sets the background color to yellow.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The third one puts a border around the hearder that is 1 pixel wide, solid,
                        and colored black.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The second rule starts with a p selector, which means that it will apply its property values to the &ltp>
                     element. It contains one declaration, which sets the text color to red.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="How_does_CSS_actually_work?">
                <header>How does CSS actually work?</header>
                <p>
                    When a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's content with its style information.
                    It processes the document in two stages:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The browser converts HTML and CSS into the DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM represents the document
                            in the computer's memory. It combines the document's content with its style.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The browser displays the contents of the DOM.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="About_the_DOM">
                <header>About the DOM</header>
                <p>
                    A DOM has a tree-like structure. Each element, attribute and piece of text in the markup language becomes a DOM node 
                    in the tree structure. The nodes are defined by their relationship to other DOM nodes. Some elements are parents of
                    child nodes, and child nodes have siblings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Understanding the DOM helps you design, debug and maintain your CSS because the DOM is where your CSS and docuemnts's 
                    content meet up.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="DOM_representation">
                <header>DOM representation</header>
                <p>
                    Rather than a long, boring explanation, let's take an example to see how the DOM and CSS work together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's assume the following HTML code:
                </p>
                <div class="code-box">
                    <code>
                        &ltp>
                        Let's use:
                            &ltspan>Cascading&lt/span>
                            &ltspan>Style&lt/span>
                            &ltspan>Sheets&lt/span>
                        &lt/p>
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    In the DOM, the node corresponding to our &ltp> element is a parent. Its children are a text node and the
                    nodes corresponding to our &ltspan> elements. The SPAN nodes are also parents, with text nodes as their
                    children: 
                </p>
                <div class="code-box">
                    <code>
                        P
                        |-"Let's use:"
                        |- SPAN
                        |    |_ "Cascading"
                        |- SPAN
                        |    |_ "Style"
                        |_ SPAN
                                |_ "Sheets"
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    This is how a browser interprets the previous HTML snippet --it renders the above DOM tree and then
                    outputs it to the browser like so:
                </p>
                <div id="html-snippet">
                    <p>
                    Let's use:
                        <span>Cascading</span>
                        <span>Style</span>
                        <span>Sheets</span>
                    </p>
                </div>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="References">
                <header>References</header>
                <p>
